# Recipes.io App
An App that allows users to store recipes, browse them, organize them by categories and view the details of a certain recipe. The user can also add a new recipe to our collection. The App contains a basic tab bar, data model, grid layout, and AsyncImage. Besides a tab user interface that switches between the main screens of the App, the home screen also presents a list of recipes in the form of cards with images stored remotely. Each card can be redirected to a specific recipe outlining its details. The recipes can also be accessed from the categories where the recipes are filtered by type of meal. All that was for browsing purposes. The App was built from Scratch.
